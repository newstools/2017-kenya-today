By Odumbe Isaac Kute Dear NASA supporters. Friday is here. They have kithnid and ndeknid and Uncle David shall speak. The power of incumbency is like riding a tiger. The only way you get off before your time, is if either you or the tiger dies. If the Supreme Court rules for the petitioner, I will strip naked and run the one and a half miles from Harrow Road to Paddington.Uhuruto stopped the ICC dead in its tracks by using the sheer magnitude of the country s civilian, military and intelligence assets. The 7 ladies and gentlemen of the Supreme court are a walk in the park for them. That s how the resident bandits who run predatory states operate. When the IEBC brazenly disobeys an order from the Supreme Court, the message is clear Mta do? I was asked a question right here on FB a couple of months ago: Who do you think will win the election . My answer was as blunt as it gets. It doesn t matter who will win the 2017 election, Uhuru Kenyatta will be declared President.There, I said it. If anything different happens, watch out on Sky News or London tonight for a naked fella running down from W9 to Paddington Station.
