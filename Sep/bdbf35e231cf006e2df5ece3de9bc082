When NASA leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka petitioned against Kenyatta s win, so many people said they couldn t win against the government. But I m now happy the truth and will of the people have been been affirmed through the judgment,&#8221; Jack Gitonga, a trader in Meru is quoted by the Star. Let s be prepared for the next election and peacefully allow every leader to come and request our votes, Gitonga added.Another resident Julius Muthomi said, The percentage results shown on the IEBC portal is proof there were malpractices. It is the right time now for truth and justice to prevail. I hope Raila wins.&#8221;&#8220;It is obvious our votes here did not count, those project from Bomas were all computer generated, we voted for Raila here but then they only said it was just 10% yet am sure we were more than 40% who voted for Raila&#8221;- Nephat Muthembei told this writerHowever, a few of the residents expressed their disappointment following the verdict. Uhuru has the best vision for this country so let s go out on Election Day and vote him in wholeheartedly, Faith Kiunga, a resident is quoted by the daily https://www.kenya-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21307304_1929158893991696_115808424427520000_n.mp4
