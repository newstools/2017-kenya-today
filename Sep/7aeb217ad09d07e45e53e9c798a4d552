By Dorcas S Here is the video of Moses Kuria, Ferdinand Waititu and a handful of other speakers currently doing the rounds on social media and though I don t understand Gikuyu, the accompanying comments in response (to said video) allude to its content as prime examples of extreme hate speech and incitement. https://www.kenya-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1.mp4 The comments also follow a predictable &#8220;For&#8221; and &#8220;Against&#8221; divide as evidenced by an unscientific tabulation using the commenters names as indication of their tribe.The 18-minute long video is fiery and angry and the crowd is equally fired up but not in the Obamaesque Fired Up/Ready to Go kinda way. Not even close!The crowd is angry. It is also baying for blood and I will venture to say that had there been a Luo or pro-RAO person in their midst &#8230;.Suffice to say, the video is a very disturbing!Stateside there is an unspoken rule that the children (and spouses) of politicians are out of bounds and are not to be attacked or mentioned while campaigning. Well one of the speaker tosses aside that courtesy in the flying toilet of uber-tribal hatred and sense of entitlement.Kuria pretty much accuses Raila of sacrificing his late son Fidel kwa mashetani , how petty and crazy can one be?.Kuria goes on to poke fun at Raila Junior and in an unintelligent garble, the speaker goes after Rosemary as well. This he does even as the crowd roars its approval; evoking images of the hordes at white supremacist rallies psyching themselves up before they go out and terrorize black neighborhoods under cover of dark!Speaker after speaker breathes fire, bile and venom at one of God&#8217;s own creation &#8211; along with his base &#8211; even as some of the commenters describe their choice for the upcoming re-election as &#8220;God&#8217;s Chosen Leader&#8221; causing me to wonder which God would choose such a leader!So, the video I watched was posted yesterday (9/5) at 12:14PM. It is now 3:14AM (9/7) and I am yet to see, hear or read anything from the National Cohesion and Integration (NCIS) in response to what is obviously incitement and hate speech from two repeat offenders no less!
