CLARIFICATION ON ALLEGED MEMO FROM THE COMMISSIONOur attention has been drawn to media reports on alleged 12 issues on the just concluded General Election. The issues are captured in a memo allegedly written by the Chairman, Mr. Wafula Chebukati to the CS/CEO, Mr. Ezra Chiloba.We wish to clarify that the contents of the said memo were not discussed and sanctioned by the Commission Plenary. The Commissioners came to know of the memo through the media like everyone else.A quick perusal of the memo shows that the allegations are based on some report or information that has not been brought to the attention of the Commission. Most of the issues raised are not factual and could easily mislead if taken out of context. However, the Secretariat is reviewing the issues and will prepare appropriate responses to be presented to the Commission Plenary.We wish to reassure the country that the Commission is in the process of preparing for a fresh presidential election to be held on 17th October 2017. Our commitment is to ensure that a credible process is held in line with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in its brief judgment. We invite all Kenyans to stand by the Commission as it carries out this mandate.VICE CHAIRPERSON CONSALATA NKATHA MAINA COMMISSIONER PROF. YAKUB GULIYE COMMISSIONER AMB.
