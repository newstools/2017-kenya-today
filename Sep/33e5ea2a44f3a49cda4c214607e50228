There are fears for the commission officials especially those seen to be keen on unraveling the misery surrounding the August 8th polls.Raila said the IEBC commissioners&#8217; lives are in danger following the leaked memo and that they should be protected.&#8220;They are receiving emails threatening their lives. They are in a dangerous situation.&#8221;Concerns about the safety of IEBC officials arose after the murder of acting ICT manager Chris Msando, who was tortured and strangled.Raila asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to resign following the &#8220;sham election&#8221; on August 8 that was masterminded by his presidential agent Davis Chirchir and other Jubilee operatives.In a memo on Thursday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati detailed numerous failures by the secretariat that formed a key part of Supreme Court proceedings.Chebukati raised questions on Al Ghurair Printing &#038; Publishing, security features on election material, the KIEMS system and the creation of an account in his name.Raila said this vindicated the Opposition and added on Friday that it is now clear the election was rigged.He said the President should release the people of Kenya from a repeat of elections.&#8220;Uhuru and Jubilee should resign and let Kenyans move on. Everything is now clear&#8230;he lost,&#8221; the ODM leader told a press conference.&#8220;If I were Uhuru I would just resign and leave this thing. Must you impose yourself on the people of Kenya? Now he is trying to buy individuals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We urge Jubilee to do the right thing.&#8221;He further said the National Super Alliance has a team ready for discussions with IEBC, when they get ready.Opposition leaders earlier said they were not consulted in the setting of the October 17 date for the fresh presidential poll.A meeting between IEBC officials and Jubilee Party members failed to take off on Thursday. This was after the Jubilee team demanded to have NASA in the meeting.&#8220;I will attend the meeting only if the Jubilee candidate will be attending. NASA is ready for any discussion,&#8221; Raila said.
