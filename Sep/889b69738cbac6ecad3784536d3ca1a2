By Cathy via FBThe Rt.Hon.Raila Amollo Odinga is a Christian and so is H.E Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta,one is an Anglican while the other is a Catholic&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s is the undisputable truth!They both believe in the God of the Bible!Give me a reason why one should ever go to such a church.Give me a reason why one&#8217;s head should not snap and completely dislodged from matters of religion.&#8220;There&#8217;s an assumption if you are a Kikuyu you have to support your own a week to election my heart was bleeding coz the pastor didn&#8217;t care he&#8217;s was biased and commanded the congregation thiei muikerie kamwana kura tiganai na kihii kana atia andu aitu actually the following Sunday didn&#8217;t go to church I all go after election are over&#8221;&#8211; Mercy Ngima notesSince Friday&#8217;s ruling by the Supreme court I have found myself wondering&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;1.Why are JP supporters behaving as if God is &#8216;pretty unhappy&#8217; with that court ruling??2.Didn&#8217;t we see NASA Leaders hold several prayer meetings around supreme court and away from it?3.Isn&#8217;t our God a just one??4.Radio presenters and evangelical preachers on Kameme FM are castigating their(NASA&#8217;s) God&#8230;&#8230; who is their God?Don&#8217;t we(Christians) whether Kikuyu&#8217;s,Luos,kambas,Luhyas e.t.c worship the same God??Is their our God and their God?God knows what is good for our country. The bible says he is a just God,a fair God.He&#8217;ll make everything beautiful in his own time.He&#8217;ll give Kenya the RIGHT Leader whether Uhuru or Raila. Let&#8217;s stop this HYPOCRISY. https://www.kenya-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21307304_1929158893991696_115808424427520000_n-1.mp4
