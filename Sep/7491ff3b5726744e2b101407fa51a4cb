You will have to read this story to understand this one.Up to 15 million personal biometric records of Kenyan voters are in the hands of a gang of criminal hackers who were commissioned by the Jubilee administration to hack and manipulate IEBC&#8217;s Result Transmission System (RTS).The criminals, including Chinese, Russian and westerners working in cahoots with IEBC CEO Ezra Chiloba and Director of ICT James Muhati, managed to create a replica clone of the KIEMS servers and with it took total control of the IEBC&#8217;s Results Transmission Systems (RTS) which they manipulated well ahead of voting day to secure a fake electoral win for President Uhuru Kenyatta and also create a Jubilee majority.It happened days before the election. A partial audit of IEBC servers revealed that three days to the election, presidential results had started streaming in. The full extent of the rigging is yet to be ascertained, as Jubilee and IEBC continue to reject and resist any scrutiny of the IEBC servers.What Kenyans now know is that no election happened. All the long queues and the githeri men were merely rituals. The election was conducted by computer algorithms. Less than five people voted for over fifteen million people.Diplomats, many who were quick to endorse the dubious IEBC results, now rate the IEBC server breach as the most vicious criminal assault on the democracy of any African state in the last 50 years.It is not clear what crimes the millions of stolen Kenyan biometrics plus other details like phone numbers will end up being used to commit and cyber security experts say that for biometrics, once stolen, are lost forever and prone to eternal misuse since an individual can never replace their fingerprints or face.Worse, biometrics uniquely identify a person, meaning that individuals can be easily traced by criminals or be impersonated in elections, or in banking transactions, or used classified access control or in just about any security system that uses biometrics.The one man who has been identified is Manwa Magoma, read his role here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
