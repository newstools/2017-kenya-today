By Salim Lone via FacebookAnd let us also remember today Chris Msando, who was murdered so the election, which Uhuru had lost the day NASA was born, could be stolen. But his murder backfired. All fair minded Kenyans were horrified that this regime would kill a person whose integrity was impregnable.The pain and tears of his family and all those who loved him can never be wiped away. But please be assured that Kenyans will always remember him for his commitment to respect the will of Kenyans to choose the leaders of their choice, and the which direction they want their country to take.His death definitely not in vain. He will forever stand in Kenya and Africa as the symbol of what free elections mean.
