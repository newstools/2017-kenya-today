Dear Madam Speaker, My name is Albert Nyakundi Amenya aka the Banana Peddler. I huckster my Bananas in the streets of Kisii County. Let me start by congratulating your lordship Hon Beatrice Elachi for your deserved election as Speaker of Nairobi Assembly. This was sweet victory because members across the political parties voted you.Sincerely, Wewe ni Simba. You have confirmed that you are not only pulchritudinous, but also intelligent. I am proud of your sterling courage and doggedness.Madam, I am aware in the past your disappointments have been there. However, this victory has surely assuaged all that. You have shown that with determination, hard work and prayers one can attain the impossible.Your highness, you have equally demonstrated that preparation meeting opportunity is the true definition of luck and not luck conferred by accident of a nomenclature.You have eliminated chance from the act of political re-engineering. In the place of luck and chance you, you have substituted resilience, doggedness, vision, proper strategy and action. As they say, The harder the fight, the sweeter the victory Madam, your victory signposts the triumph of the people of Nairobi over ineptitude, cluelessness, bad governance, impunity and brazen corruption.Madam Elachi, with your pedigree of integrity, courage and vision cannot but take our county to greater heights and make Nairobi respected and admired once again in the comity of nations. You have left no one in doubt that you are ready to tackle the myriads of problems besetting this county since independence.Your overwhelming support from both NASA and Jubilee confirms you are too determined to be defeated, too courageous to be cowed, too strong to be shaken and too focused to be hoodwinked.The MCA s have raised their standard with their votes. They have proved that only in you they trust.From my side, I wish you good luck madam.Yours SincerelyAlberto the Banana Peddler
