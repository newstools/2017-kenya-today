On the other hand, it is not anything to be proud of. There is no sin in being kikuyu. There is also no achievement in being born one. And so, I speak as a kikuyu. And I speak about Uhuru Kenyatta&#8217;s promise/threat to &#8220;revisit&#8221; the Supreme Court once (or if) he is re-elected in 57 days time. You see, I know that in times of heated political contests such as this, it is easy for us to get hysterical at the slightest perception of injustice. It is hard for many of us to have a sense of the long-term. Yet, I must appeal to us (the kikuyu &#8220;nation&#8221;) to consider today&#8217;s debate with the long-term future in mind. If we do so, we shall defend the Supreme Court with all our energies.Believe you me, and as I have said many times, in Kenya&#8217;s ethnic-sensitive society nobody needs functioning and independent institutions more than the kikuyu. For the simple reason that the kikuyu remain the easiest to mobilize AGAINST due to certain anti-kikuyu sentiments that run quite deep amongst people of certain regions. What if soon after we have demolished the independence of the judiciary a certain kikuyu hater rose to the presidency of Kenya (by whatever means)? To where would we run? Do you remember me making similar sentiments when most of you were saying we should withdraw Kenya from the ICC? Didn&#8217;t Raila Odinga the other day reject election results and initiallu refused to go to Court at what point all of you must have appreciated the wisdom of Kenya remaining in the ICC? Indeed, by attacking the independent institutions, isn&#8217;t Uhuru Kenyatta (perhaps unwittingly) setting us up for a potential future genocide? Kai murega akiruo ndaregaga akihetwo-i!
