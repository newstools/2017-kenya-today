Statehouse is in panic after Nyeri Town MP Hon Ngunjiri Wambugu&#8217;s ill advised move to to file petition for removal of CJ David Maraga caused a storm on social media with all Kenyans including those in deep Mt Kenya and Kalenjin land condemning it.Although a section of Kenyans especially the blind followers of President Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto were angered by Maraga&#8217;s bench ruling they however agree in principal that elections were bungled and are ok with a bolden judiciary that is out to defend justice.Statehouse operatives who crafted the Ngunjiri petition run into panic and immeditely summoned Gusii Jubilee leaders to condemn Hon Wambugu is a bid to do damage control in Gusii land.It is imprtant to note that Maraga is the only Gusii person who has held a postion of title of President since independence. Jubilee MPs from Kisii region demand that Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu to withdraw the petition seeking the removal of CJ David Maraga Hon Jimmy Angwenyi, Richard Tongi and Hon Nyamoko led their Gusii MPs in condemning Hon Ngunjiri&#8217;s petition.Word on the street is that Statehouse operatives are keen on removing CJ Maraga and part of the plot is to lie to the Kisii people that the position will be given to Charles Nyachae BUT in reality they want the position to go to the president of Court of Appeal Justice Kihara. They will use Nyachae&#8217;s name as pawn but in the end reward Justice Kariuki Kihara. They lied that they will make Nyachae AG but ended up giving it to Prof Githu Muigai and also they lied that he will be senate speaker BUT they gave it to Lusaka.
