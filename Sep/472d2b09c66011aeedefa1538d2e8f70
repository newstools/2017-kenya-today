Hassan Omar has resigned as Wiper secretary general citing &#8220;deep rooted&#8221; reasons and his inability to carry on following his elections loss.Governor Hassan Joho (ODM) trounced the former Senator in the August 8 vote. Others who vied were Jubilee Party&#8217;s Suleiman Shahbal and former Nyali MP Hezron Awiti.In a letter to Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Thursday, Omar said he informed NASA before the election that he would not be a member if he lost.&#8220;That was not rhetoric. It is still the case. As such it is unlikely that I will play any part in your October 17 presidential quest but nonetheless I wish you all the best,&#8221; Omar said. A He noted the resignation notice was the most difficult letter he has written in a long time.Omar said he needs to re-organise himself where politics is concerned.&#8220;As pertains to seeking electoral justice, the re-organisation of my politics &#8211; if at all &#8211; and my endeavours towards personal development and re-positioning the discourse for social justice, make my position as secretary general untenable.&#8221;Omar thanked Kalonzo, who is NASA&#8217;s Deputy President candidate, for &#8220;unequivocal support, friendship and partnership&#8221; during his tenure.&#8220;It was indeed an exciting and memorable journey with memories that I will cherish and experience I will apply in my journey of life.&#8221;In July, Omar refuted speculation that he was a mole planted by Jubilee to scuttle NASA campaigns in Mombasa.He tore into Joho, once saying he has no agenda for Mombasa people.
