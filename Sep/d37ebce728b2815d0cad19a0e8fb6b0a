By Diana Okello via FBRaila needs to stand his ground ,let&#8217;s form a caretaker government and then hold fresh elections in 6 months.This whole election was shambolic ,from the nominations to the ballot .If Kenyans are serious about change ,we must open a new page . Please don&#8217;t feed me the &#8220;country needs to move on bullshit&#8221;.What Kenya needs is a complete overhaul of the IEBC and the parties involved in this election, that&#8217;s Jubilee and NASA. If Raila really wants change we must start from our doorstep. We cannot claim justice when we don&#8217;t practice it . If Raila makes the mistake of taking part in the Octobrr 17th polls he is going to be rigged out again this time by a bigger margin Jubilee operatives have a point to prove so they will work twice as much and they don&#8217;t care.
