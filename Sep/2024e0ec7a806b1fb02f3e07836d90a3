&#8220;I m not a politician and I work based on the principles of the oath of allegiance I took to serve Kenyans, I don&#8217;t support Jubilee or NASA or anybody. I just follow our constitution. Go ahead and conduct elections and if someone is not contented bring the petition with good evidence and we will act accordingly as per the constitution and existing legal principles. Note that I only FEAR God.&#8221; -Justice Maraga https://www.kenya-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/VID-20170902-WA0005.mp4 https://www.kenya-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-2.mp4
