By Wisdom KEWhy is president Uhuru so desperate?If I were Uhuru Kenyatta and I had won the 8th August election fair and square, I wouldn&#8217;t;1. Get mad at the Supreme Court judges to an extent of threatening them with impeachment, Calling them thugs&#8230;2. Spend a lot of money buying opposition politicians like Isaac Rutto, Moses Akaranga et al who had no value to the opposition itself in the last election according to Jubilee&#8230;..3. Pleading with rebel politicians like Peter Munya who we call tumbocrats&#8230;.4. Host a number of meaningless meetings with old political rejects in opposition zones in an attempt to solicit support from their regions&#8230;.5. Hold rallies and campaign as if the world ends the following day, after all, I won and the numbers are still intact, what&#8217;s the worry???6. Spend hundreds of millions buying IDs from opposition supporters in a bid to disenfranchise them on the day of voting, in other words attempt to reduce opposition numbers&#8230;.7. Constantly get drunk and reminding everyone who cares to listen that I am the president. If I won I would be calm because I believe I have the People&#8217;s mandate, I wouldn&#8217;t crave legitimacy to an extent of addressing a divided Parliament without the judicial arm of the government&#8230;.8. Think about impeaching my competitor when he wins the presidency, I wouldn&#8217;t need to think of that if I have the numbers&#8230;9. And most importantly, advocate for the retention of the same election officials whose negligence lead to the nullification of my &#8220;well deserved win&#8221;. I would be at the forefront urging them to leave so that their negligence doesn&#8217;t cost me another victory&#8230;.But again I&#8217;m not Uhuru Kenyatta and &#038; he never won any election so his worry and desperation are justified because he is going to be defeated in the repeat election.
