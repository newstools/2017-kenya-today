Martha Karua sues IEBC and Anne Waiguru, saying she was added 58,000 votes and that her agents were chased from some polling stations.Imagine if Karua&#8217;s agents could be chased, Raila Odinga&#8217;s agents? Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has filed a petition at the Kerugoya High Court challenging Anne Waiguru&#8217;s election as Kirinyaga Governor.Through lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, Karua said the August 8 election was not free and fair.She cited the Supreme Court ruling that nullified the election of President Uhuru Kenyatta for a second term.The former Gichugu MP said the verdict delivered by Chief Justice David Maraga in support of three other Supreme Court judges set precedent.She said the ruling affects the governor, senator and MP elections.&#8220;This election was held on the same day the IEBC conducted polls in the country,&#8221; Imanyara told journalists after they filed the petition.In her petition, Karua alleges the forgery of the form 37A used to transmit results from polling centers to the county tallying centre.She further claims unauthorised persons manned voting centres.Karua said evidence in her possession shows a count of 58,000 votes was illegally entered into IEBC&#8217;s KIEMS to aid Waiguru&#8217;s win.IEBC, the county returning officer, Waiguru and Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri are respectively listed as respondents in the case.
