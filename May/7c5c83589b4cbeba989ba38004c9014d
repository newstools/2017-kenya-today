Four suspects are being held in connection with vandalism of the Standard Gauge Railways at Kibanda-Hasara in Kwale County, about 30km west of Mombasa. The suspects include scrap metal dealers who were arrested in Voi Town in possession of materials including metal rails. The suspects who are part of Uhuru Jubilee&#8217;s #6MillionStrong are Samuel Kamau Maina, Joseph Mbugua and James Ndichu with the same offence.Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko said the suspects and any others who will be caught will be charged as organised criminals and economic saboteurs. All those identified and apprehended will face the full force of the law and will be charged and prosecuted not as petty thieves but as organized criminals and economic saboteurs, he said in a statement. He added police are looking for more suspects. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said they had expanded operations on vandals and would target those damaging power pylons and road furniture. Anyone found over this issue will be heavily punished, he warned. Vandalism of the rails happened on Friday night less than a week to the launch of the SGR. The vandals also destroyed communication cables. A 30-metre long fence was also destroyed. The affected section is part of phase one of SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi that cost a massive Sh327 billion. There are indications the saboteurs used specialised cutting tools before taking away the heavy steel components.
