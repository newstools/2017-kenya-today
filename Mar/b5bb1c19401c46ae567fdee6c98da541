By Staff WriterThe Heads of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and the Office of the Directorate of Public Prosecution have been severely repremanded by the powers that be for failing to arrest and charge Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho for purportedly forging an examination result slip.The two offices are under immense pressure from State House functionaries to remain in pursuit of investigating the Joho case so that the governor can be produced in court as soon as possible.Governor Joho s file at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations appears to have hit a dead end as the Directorate of Public Prosecution desperately fishes for evidence on prosecution file to charge the resurgent governor. The renewed activity follows and angry phone from state house that was not amused by the governor s robust response earlier this week in which he recorded a statement and held a victorious but impromptu mammoth rally soon after. Joho s statement completely punctured the cooked evidence that had been prepared to nail him by exposing state induced forgeries. Even more amazing was Joho s pulling the carpet from under Jubilee feet by proudly announcing to the country that he was not going to run away from his high school grades however bad they are. Jubilee s idea of embarrassing Joho was to publicize his results which were deemed insufficient to gain university admission without doing a bridging course.The apparent stagnation of Joho s case has reportedly angered President Uhuru who had earlier been assured by DCI who were working in cahoots with the DPP that the evidence they had created against Joho was air-tight and that Joho was likely to be in police custody awaiting court appearance next week.A state house source who wishes to remain anonymous whispered to Kenya Today that a furious Uhuru has reportedly placed calls to the heads of DCI and DPP and read the riot act to them for embarrassing him and allowing Joho to walk away to political victory scot-free despite earlier assurances that he would be dealt with conclusively using instruments of state.As observers ponder on the future of the two state institutions, it would seem that only then will Uhuru&#8217;s prophesy of &#8220;dealing with Joho&#8221; will have been fulfilled.The similarity of the ethnic origin of the bosses of state organizations put together to fight Governor Joho has also opened another can of worms Jubilee would have preferred to keep closed.It remains to be seen which new war front Jubilee will open with Governor Joho who remains a constant thorn in the backside of an increasingly intolerant government.
