By Seth OAfter five years of failure and heavy indulgence President Uhuru is now quoting the Bible per nanosecond and praying ceaselessly in a bid to appease Kenyan Christians who are taught to forgive. Where were the prayers in 2013,2014,2015,2016? God hates pretense! After realizing rigging no longer possible now Uhuru has become Kenya&#8217;s Prayer Partner No.1.Christianity should stop entertaining mediocrity. I now get why developed nations become less and less religious, particularly the strain of religion where Christianity falls. The rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, thou shall not steal, thou shall not murder, let&#8217;s carry the burden of those suffering, blessed are the pure in heart, etc; these are every day experiences that people should live and abide by. Jubilee politicians are today throwing religion in our faces as if what is to happen next week is a national salvation redemption, not the simple political process of free adults exercising universal suffrage. Ooh, he also sings&#8230;off key though.
