Open Letter To H.E Uhuru KenyattaCongratulations on your re-election as our President. Truth be told, over 7million voted for your re-election, whilst over 6million voted for Raila Odinga. I was amongst the 6million. It looks likely our candidate lost fairly. IEBC conducted credible elections.When I decided to vote for Raila, it is not because we stopped being friends, but because I truly believed his vision of Canaan maybe a better alternative. Some friends tell me they have not been employed or promoted because of their tribe. I meet many people everyday who tell me that they have been left out.I voted for Raila because Canaan promises equity and equality for all. In Canaan, the rain will fall on all, and the sun shine on everyone. In Canaan, I looked forward to Martin Luther&#8217;s dream that we we will all be judged by the content of our character and not our accidental birth as Kalenjin, Kikuyu, Kamba, Luhya, Miji Kenda, Somali or Luo.But as you are the winner, remember your campaign promises. Those who voted for you and those who voted for Raila have same aspirations. We all belong to one Kenya. Let everyone stay inside the tent. As the great Socrates said, magnanimity is the greatness of soul, mind and heart.Be magnanimous in victory. Don&#8217;t let Nyanza, Coast and Eastern feel locked out. Don&#8217;t let them feel besieged. You are our President.
