By Fred G.Typically, police don&#8217;t kill protesters because of looting. If that were the case, 3/4 (estimated figure) of government workers would be dead.No, they are killed because they are poor, &#8220;scum of the earth&#8221; whose lives don&#8217;t matter. Even where teargas could have worked effectively, cops (not sure whether they have a conscience or not) unleash live bullets, snuffing out lives like some sort of joke.That said, no unjust killing of these largely unarmed young people will go unpunished. Thankfully, we won&#8217;t be in your life to witness your reward. But it will be exceedingly painful.On a related note, I was hoping Acting CS Matiangi (I am told by some he is an Elder of the Seventh Day Adventist Church) would be the Daniel of our times even if it means losing his job &#8211; stand up for what is right, ask his officers to use proportionate force at all times. Sadly, he is not. He is even describing the murders as &#8220;rumour and innuendo.&#8221; Eish! Halafu bado ataenda kanisa akae pale mbele? Na asome lesni? Na aimbe?Before you bring your comments and likes here, first ask yourself:1. I am happy (or find it reasonable) with what the cops are doing. What would I do if I was on the other side?2. I am saddened by what the cops are doing. Would I behave the same way if I was on the other side?If you are incapable of feeling the pain of those you differ with politically, just read and reflect. Don&#8217;t comment.
