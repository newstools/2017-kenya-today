The United States and the United Kingdom are gravely concerned by the murder of IEBC s Systems Development Manager Christopher Msando. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and the entire IEBC team. It is critical that Kenya have free, fair, credible and peaceful elections on August 8, and protection for IEBC staff is essential to achieving this goal. We welcome the Government of Kenya s commitment to investigating the murder. We have offered our assistance in the investigation.Robert F.
