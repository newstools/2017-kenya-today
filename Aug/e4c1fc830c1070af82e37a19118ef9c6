With deep social ties to the landlocked Central Republic &#x1f1f8;&#x1f1e9; , which is where I was born and raised, anyone who knows me understands that am a big loser if the People&#8217;s Republic &#x1f1f8;&#x1f1f8; of Kenya were to secede. My kids would need visas to visit their granma, plus my Kenyan certificates obtained right from nursery to my alma mater JKUAT may never be recognized in the new state. Which is why we have to take this secessionist talk seriously, before it evolves into an aspiration of the 40 tribe coalition behind it. You see in the 40s and 50s Kenyans yearned for independence, then in the 80s we yearned for democracy then it came briefly in 2002 before it became a charade, then we thought a new constitution and digital elections will help, but UhuRuto have learned how to skirt around the 2010 constitution to advance their mischievous and devious deeds. Now, thanks to rigging, I can report that the 2010 constitution is on the verge of failing to unite us, and SECESSION talk is emerging as the new COOL- the new aspiration of the non presidential tribes. Uhuru&#8217;s best bet is persuasion and not state violence. People have to sit down and renegotiate new terms of engagement. The bullet or instituting apartheid won&#8217;t resolve this new mess that Jubilee finds itself in. Firming up of agenda 3 and Chapter 6 will help reassure the People&#8217;s Republic to stay in the marriage. I would vouch for us to sit and talk but should it become inevitable only the sitting president can ensure that the divorce is peaceful and amicable by just signing the paperwork and instruments of separation.
