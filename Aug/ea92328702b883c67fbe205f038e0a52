The UNSUNG NASA hero of 2017 is Kilifi ODM giant Amason Kingi. In his county, he did not just completely obliterate his competitors, but he ensured ODM carried the day by scooping all the 35 WARDS, ALL the 7 MP seats and Raila too scooped the presidential vote with a yawning margin alongside the women Rep.This soft spoken gentleman is a strategic colossus beyond peradventure; a tactical wizard heavily armed with a bravura finale which he stunningly put on a stellar display to the shock and awe of his competitors. This is the real fire and fury in war; the real fire and forget in Missile technology. In Kilifi County Assembly there is no minority party or leader of minority, only leader of majority and only ODM confederates PERIOD! Kingi has superlatively scored a remarkable feat, by not only surviving a ferocious Jubilee onslaught led by Uhuru but thoroughly beating them like a talking drum. History will be charitable to you Kingi you remain one hell of a tactical genius Congrats.
