UHURU KENYATTA ACTING IN BAD FAITH: This morning, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave notice of the first sitting of the 12th Parliament to be from August 31. This is despite the fact that Uhuru s re-election is the subject of a Supreme Court case where judgement is not expected until September 1, 2017.There is a rush certainly, suicidal in our view, by Mr. Kenyatta to defraud Kenyans into believing that all is well and that he is rightly and properly in office. It is a psychological war that is meant to make Kenyans adjust into accepting a third stolen election as they await a fourth similar fraud in 2022.NASA rejects this fraudulent attempt by Jubilee to burry reality. President Uhuru should seek to overcome the divisions in Kenyan society that the campaign and his so-called victory have highlighted. Recognizing and respecting the fact that he has only a disputed mandate as yet and that his so-called victory is being challenged would be a useful first step in calming down our increasingly restive society.The path he has embarked on will certainly deepen the crisis of governance that has troubled the country these past 10 years beginning with the stolen elections of 2007. We remind Jubilee that in the wake of the botched 2013 elections and the Supreme Court s controversial decision, a huge section of our country never accepted the legitimacy of jubilee regime, even as we agreed to put up with it for the sake of the country. Continuing on this path will never be helpful at all.NASA members will stay away from the swearing in until the matters surrounding Uhuru s supposed re-election are heard and credibly determined. We will not party to processes geared towards sanitizing fraud.HON JUNET MOHAMMED, DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS ODM; FOR NASA NATIONAL STEARING COMMITTEE.
