Latest unconfirmed information from Bomas indicate that IEBC has only been able to produce 11000 forms 34As instead of the 28000 Mr. Chilloba earlier claimed they had so far.The process is moving slow and tiring. Both Raila and Uhuru are for a credible outcome and are said to be patient for a comprehensive conclusion of the process.The 11000 forms cannot add up to the over 14,000,000 votes already tallied that put Uhuru way ahead.Chilloba can&#8217;t explain from where he came up with the 28000 number of forms!Yesterday commission chairman Wafula Chebukati declared all results that have been streaming on our screens null or unofficial.Meanwhile both NASA are Jubilee technical teams are busy authenticsting the text results and figures captured in forms 34A
