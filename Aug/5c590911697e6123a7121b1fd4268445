By Kipkemboi Jacob RotichThe coincidence in which &#8220;observers&#8221; rushed to endorse Uhuru&#8217;s &#8220;win&#8221; surprised even diehard jubilants. Of course, we Nasarites were sorely disappointed. But unknown to the vast majority who no longer do any meaningful study, and especially those hiding in the &#8220;safety&#8221; of the church, the FASCIST regime being set up in Kenya and everywhere in the world will lead us to the much talked about APOCALYPSE, (Chiloba &#038; CS Matiangi know this very well, don&#8217;t ask me how).You saw how the &#8220;international&#8221; community rushed to congratulate the &#8220;winner&#8221; even before IEBC made the formal announcement. This is part of a worldwide conspiracy prophesied long ago in the Holy Book:&#8220;These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beat&#8221; Revelation 17:13What we are witnessing in Kenya now has nothing to do with Jubilee/Nasa. These are only but temporary instruments in the coming to birth of the New World Order, a worldwide system of governance that will own everything except oxygen.In its attempt to attain complete dominance, this world government will not shrink from trying anything. As you already know, human life itself is no longer considered sacred. Experiments have already been done and worldlings are no longer moved by the most revolting atrocities. In the Holy Book, this system is referred to as Babylon. The Holy Book describes the end of Babylon thus:&#8220;For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities&#8230;Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her&#8221; Revelation 18:5,8One day soon you will wake up to news of ONE WORLD LEADER endorsed by your government and church. The same supreme leader will claim spiritual allegiance. He will have the entire world at his feet. The song of the moment will be &#8220;ACCEPT IN ORDER TO LIVE.&#8221;A tiny minority will form the last resistance just before the APOCALYPSE. They will be true to conscience. They will stand by the moral law as contained in the Holy Book. They will refuse to worship a fellow human being. They will be objects of universal execration. Every human system will work against them. They will live each moment anticipating danger and death. But God will be on their side:&#8220;&#8230;And the heavens departed as a scroll&#8230;and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?As the journey to Canaan continues through the Supreme Court, that verdict, whatever it is, will be one more step towards the NWO. The journey to the Heavenly Canaan is the real deal. You have not heard of spiritual hacking yet. Start engaging your pastor or simply start reading and praying for yourself. This one has no neutral ground. The test will be universal and personal.Hapa ndio nimefika reading religion, literature and philosophy. Political correctness will be directly opposed to your eternal interests. Be careful. God bless you.
