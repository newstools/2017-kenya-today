Life is a constant struggle between a kek and a cuck, it is said. And while at it, who is Mercy Chebeni, the ODM youth nominee to senate and what has been her role in our struggle? If she has no history of struggle then maybe let&#8217;s know whose great granddaughter, granddaughter, daughter, sister, niece, cousin or concubine she is.Let&#8217;s know if she is a widow of one of the many young people in ODM whose lives ended at the ricocheting of the gun, right there on the battle field.Let&#8217;s know if she is the granddaughter of those venerables of Kenya People&#8217;s Union, whose love for country led them to a warpath with old Jomo.Let&#8217;s know if she is one of the many legal assistants in the &#8220;law firms of the struggle&#8221;, such as JAB Orengo advocates, who toil in the shadows to put points of law together, for the great work of constitutionalism. Let&#8217;s know if she is a cleaner in the many party offices and secretariats that keep the movement going. And if she is someone&#8217;s concubine, that too is fine for we now know just how critical a young woman called Carol Wairimu Ngumbu was to the struggle, for she kept Chris Msando sane and focused, as he carried all those algorithms of democracy! No role is insignificant. So let the young people of ODM know Mercy Chebeni and her contribution, and honor and respect her for what, or who, she is. It is true that a movement as broad and ubiquitous as ODM has cadres you can&#8217;t know but this other part is also true; if you are to represent young people &#8211; the heart and soul of our movement &#8211; at least a brief synopsis of your role, especially if you need introduction, should accompany your choice.Our movement is losing its heart and soul because our movement is being taken advantage of. Our movement is losing its &#8220;critical mass&#8221; because the rank of the movement is taking for granted the struggles waged by the file of the movement. So I join those asking who Ms. Chebeni is!Finally, as young person in ODM, the only thing you need to fear is fear Itself
