Supreme Court Judge Mohammed Ibrahim has been taken ill as election petition continues.Chief Justice David Maraga on Tuesday said Justice Ibrahim was being attended to by a doctor.The judge is on the seven-judge bench of the top court in the land hearing the petition filed by National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga challenging President Kenyatta s win in the August 8 General Election.The judge is likely to miss the Tuesday sessions on the case, where President Kenyatta&#8217;s lawyers are expected to defend his victory and ask the court to validate it.President Kenyatta s legal team comprising lawyers Fred Ngatia, Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Ken Ogeto will have three hours to argue for the dismissal of Mr Odinga&#8217;s case.Once they conclude, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and the Attorney-General Githu Muigai will have 20 minutes each to argue on points of law.
