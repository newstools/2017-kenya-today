Uthamaki ni&#8230;.. oh yes, Nyambura is in desperation, poverty knows no tribe or gender. When Raila a few weeks ago promised to cater for single mothers he clearly had in mind the likes of Nyambura and other single mothers including those who operate in Koinange steeet.For Nyambura to succeed she needs to plead with the supreme court to overturn the unjust declaration by IEBC that Uhuru won the 2017 presidential elections.Nyambura &#038;co problems will be sorted by Raila and not uthamaki.
