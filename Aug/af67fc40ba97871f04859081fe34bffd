By Cyprian Nyamwamu In February 1998, in Supili /Ng&#8217;arua Laikipia, The Late Kihika, Late Mwenje Then DP Leader Mwai Kibaki led a huge group of central Kenya MPs to mourn those who had been killed in the 1997 state sponsored killings from Likoni to Maela.The Central Kenya MPs openly called for secession and that new country was to include Nakuru, Laikipia, Meru, Embu The five Central Kenya Counties and Nairobi. Hon Kihika Kimani was to be the mobilizer of the Army..troops.Hon Mwenje said JKIA was in Embakassi and he would not allow Moi to land on leaving for an international trip. Hon Mwai Kibaki was asked to be ready to be sworn in because he had won the election anyway.The Opposition (Democratic Party) put up a serious campaign that rattled KANU. I was heading the youth arm of Charity Ngilu&#8217;s campaign in SDP called CNN but still felt the impact of Mwai Kibaki&#8217;s DP campaign.Hon Kibaki was categorical that a government that kills it&#8217;s people has no right to govern them and it&#8217;s justified for those being oppressed to secede. Bishop Ndingi Mwana&#8217;Nzeki presided over the mass. Willy M Mutunga -KHRC and Kivutha Kibwana -NCEC led our civil society wing to the Laikipia burials.Hon Kanini Kega, Hon Kimani Ichung&#8217;wah, Wafula Buke, Lempaa Soyinka Saitoti Torome (Advocate), Joe Ageyo, Beatrice Kamau, Kamanda Mucheke Steve Musau and Kepta Ombati among many others know this well.The calls for self determination come up every time people feel that a government is behaving like an occupying force which will rule not govern, by force treating certain communities like second class citizens. A bit of history does not harm.
