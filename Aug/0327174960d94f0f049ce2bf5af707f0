The USA ambassador to Kenya has called on Kenyans to maintain peace as IEBC moved to declare President Uhuru winner of the just concluded general election.Godec noted that election was largely free and fair save for transmission of results that he asked affected parties to follow due process.Godec spoke on behalf of all western diplomats in Kenya.Meanwhile ambassador James Ololo a leader of Kenyan experts in Europe had this to say:&#8220;It&#8217;s not the duty of the opposition to organise, tally and guard votes. We have an institution for this. If IEBC announces faulty results and declares losers as winners, the loss is more on the population of Kenyan and on our democracy than the opposition. This is my point. It actually means that by 2020, the children of the current leadership will be ready to take over this country and there will be no point of queuing long hours to vote, like my 83 year old mother just did.As citizens, We cannot just be supporters of political parties, we cannot just be spectators of this painful transition towards democracy. If the electoral process is free and fair and a genuine winner is announced president, governor, senator, mp or mca, we all win, even the losers win because then, the winner can be praised for good performance and punished for wrong doings, democracy wins. If we allow the vote rigging trend to pass, you&#8217;re stuck with a dictator for life. RIP Gen. Nkaissery, RIP Chris Msando.&#8221;- James Ololo
