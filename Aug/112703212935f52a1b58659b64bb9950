By Alberto AmenyaJubilee Political strategist Dr. Washington Makodingo has urged Jubilee supporters to carry themselves decorously as they celebrate President Uhuru Kenyatta&#8217;s re-election for a second term in office.Here is what he said on his Social Media accounts:&#8220;Whereas my preferred Presidential candidate won this Election, I&#8217;m acutely aware that over 6.7m people voted for Raila Odinga. A lot of these people are in great pain and it will take them a long time to come to terms with the loss (I know because I&#8217;ve been there). As those of us who won celebrate, let&#8217;s remind ourselves that despite our ballot differences, we are all still Kenyans. We still have to live with each other on a daily basis. Those who have interacted with us on social media (even when such interactions have been limited to insults) will most likely still do so.These politicians will call each other &#8220;my brother&#8221; and do business with each other. Their children will hang out together and do so happily (royalty hangs out with royalty). There&#8217;s no fighting or insults happening at personal family level.As the voters who put them in office, let us protect each other too. Let us protect the rights of each one of us to have an opinion. Let us allow people to deal with the outcome of this election the way they choose as long as it&#8217;s non-violent (in my opinion, online insults are part of non-violent means of expressing how one feels).Let us be our brother&#8217;s keeper!&#8221;
