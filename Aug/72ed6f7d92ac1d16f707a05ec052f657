By Anwar SaddatIEBC is facing serious credibility issues in their election results transmission system after their test run exposed the possibility of an embedded algorithm within their data matrix manipulation that automatically reduced the % and number of votes streamed for Dr. OdingaAll Presidential candidates were each awarded 218 votes but the IEBC result reporting system registered 217 votes for Dr. Odinga, a discrepancy of 0.06%. It is curious to note that % discrepancy of 19.6 million total registered voters as reflected on the national voters register is 1.176 million, the exact number of extra presidential ballot papers that IEBC has printed for the 2017 presidential elections.IEBC must come out and explain to us the source of the discrepancy in that we saw during their test run, and give us an assurance that their system has not been compromised by Jubilee party whom is sharing the same tallying center as IEBC.To NASA supporters, let this not alarm you. The Coalition has taken steps to ensure that our Victory will never be stollen again. NASA will be announcing their results to millions of its supporters across the country as they get them from the polling stations.And on 10/8/17, there will be great celebrations and thanksgiving at Uhuru Park as Joshua and his team embarked on the serious task of improving the lives of Kenyans that have been subjected to so much suffering by the Jubilee administration.
