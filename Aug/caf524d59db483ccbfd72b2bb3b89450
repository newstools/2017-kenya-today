PLO Lumumba appearing for IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati decided to make stuff up to sound trendy and learned but only embarrassed himself. PLO claimed that NASA super counsel Otiende Amollo had used used Pythagoras Theorem in his presentation to show that Uhuru IEBC colluded with Uuhuru to use an algorithm that maintained an 11% margin constatntly from start to the end. The truth and even a class 8 graduate will tell you that Lawyer Otiende Amollo used the algebraic linear equation y=mx+c. The Kenyan curriculum ought to be revised. It is so basic knowledge that a Professor who I expect to have learned about interrogation of research validity should have encountered y=my+c at some point in his studies. I think PLO just likes to sound Latin/Greek and big worded. In the US law is done as a doctoral level degree after folks have gathered knowledge in other areas. And I have observed these kind of basic deficiencies with Kenyan best legal minds who aren&#8217;t all rounded. It has to be the curriculum.
