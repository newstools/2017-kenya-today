By Oduor OngwenIEBC says it doesn&#8217;t have Forms 34A. These are the basic results documents originating from polling stations. You can&#8217;t prepare Form 34B without aggregating Form 34As. The inference is that Form 34Bs upon which Presidential results declaration was made is sham. Media Release Nairobi, 14th August, 2017 IEBC FAILS TO AVAIL REQUISITE FORMS 34B FROM THE CONSTITUENCIES The NASA Presidential Campaign notes with concern that the IEBC has failed and or refused to release and share copies of Forms 34Bs to candidates or their agents three days after the Commission made a declaration of the results. The Coalition s Agents have been following up with the Commission since Saturday for a release of the same to date without any success. The said Forms cannot be traced or accessed on the Commission s on line portal.We call upon the Commission to release and share all the constituency Forms 34Bs to party agents. The failure to so share can only lead to a conclusion that the Forms do not exist and the Commission is busy generating fake Forms to justify its declaration of results as made on the 11th August 2017.Ends
