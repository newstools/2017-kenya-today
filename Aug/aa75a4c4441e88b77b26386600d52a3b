This is a day of shame and sorrow. An assassin is only a coward, not a hero. That is what I will call those who took Chris Musando s life they are despicable, inhuman and cowardly beings.Chris is a son, a husband, and, a father. He is the son of a community. Chris is a patriot who sought to use his celebrated ICT genius and skills to enable Kenyans choose their government in a free and fair manner. Someone or some people have seen it fit to take away this dedicated public servant s life. But my mind is as clear as daylight. There will never be a day when an assassin will ever stop a cause and a dream that is just.My family, and the entire NASA family mourns with his wife and children and his family.What has happened to Chris Musando, is a stain on our conscience as Kenyans.To IEBC Staff with whom Chris worked, I ask you to soldier on and deliver your promise to Kenyans a free and fair election. Never has the fate of so many, relied on the actions of a few. But as my Pentagon colleagues made clear: We are too many to be intimidated.Rest in peace Chris. Your life will not be in vain. Justice will be done.
