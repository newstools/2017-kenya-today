By JBNothing has vexed me today like the irritating noise of young ODM supporters online over the nomination of alleged relative of Ogla Karani one Mercy Chebeni (congratulations), a stranger to them to represent youths in the Senate.They claim that there are youths who have toiled for the party for decades but have not been rewarded. SHUT THE FUCK UP! You should know your position in the party. By the way you&#8217;re a NOBODY. You&#8217;re just pawns in the larger game of chess. Give us peace. You should concentrate on making noise on social media, attending rallies, and swallowing bullets as you demonstrate. Nominations to Parliament is for the girlfriends and relatives of ODM fatcats, not Hoi polloi who sweat silly for the party on a daily basis. If you&#8217;re nominated to Parliament then who will shout haki yetu on the streets?Lanes please! Lanes! Stick to your lane tafadhali.
