By Tony OOn 01.08.17 I went to attend Raila&#8217;s last presidential campaign rally in Kisii. I have never seen a larger crowd than this in Kisii. Ever. Not even the 2005 orange rally came close. This one people had chosen to make a statement. They want a NASA victory. Nothing less. Even the older generation,50 and above, that do not attend such functions were well represented. The mood was electric.They had come to hear what Baba had for them.1534hrs.Baba is driven into the stadium. Shangwe na vigelegele.The young. The old. All happy to see Baba. Visibly tired.The punishing campaign schedule has slowed him. I was surprised to hear the older people in the crowd say almost in unison, &#8220;Baba should just leave,we have seen him,let him go look for votes elsewhere. He shouldn&#8217;t be punishing himself here when he should be looking for votes where he&#8217;s not sure&#8221;. It was something I had never seen happen to any other politician inside Gusii stadium. Even Nyachae didn&#8217;t receive so much love in 2002. It was awesome. And at that moment I believed this is the same hope I have seen in those crowds elsewhere. The dream is real. And for the first time I felt totally confident that Raila will win on Tuesday. I don&#8217;t have any doubt in my mind.I am off to Canaan.Saitan toka tupite.
