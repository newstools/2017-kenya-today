Hon. Babu Owino&#8220;I really wonder why church leaders are urging Raila Odinga to either concede or seek legal redress.Since when did these theological masquerades suddenly turn into advisers of Raila Odinga or have they heard that he is short of advisers?Church leaders should stick to preaching, praying, singing and eating offerings from poor Kenyans.Or since when did you see Raila Odinga interfering with their duties by baptizing people in the church?Let everyone stick to their lane.&#8221;
