By Nelson Havi via FbEntire Presidential Results uploaded and streamed by IEBC are unlawful and unconstitutional. There is nothing like provisional results. Court of Appeal held that there is only one final result; that collated and declared at the Constituency level by the Returning Officer.Chebukati has confirmed to Kenyans that results so far received and published are based on SMSs and some Forms 34A from Polling Stations. Chebukati and Chiloba have confirmed that there is credence in NASA&#8217;s complaint that Jubilee infiltrated and influenced those results.IEBC must revoke the unlawful and unconstitutional announcement of results and await the tally of Forms 34B from all 290 Constituencies. IEBC must also resist the eminent pressure and threat from Jubilee to declare Uhuru as winner on the basis of the flawed announcements.Media should not be carried away with false announcements by IEBC. Let your journalists from 290 constituencies supply results in Form 34A. Raila&#8217;s and Uhuru&#8217;s chief agents are at Bomas. Let them witness IEBC&#8217;s tally of all Forms 34B and verify against what they have from agents.All Kenyans will accept an accurate, fair and verifiable outcome of election of President irrespective of whether it is Raila or Uhuru. Kenyans deserve their popular choice, be it stagnation or change. Neither should be forced upon them by Uhuru or Raila. Let it be free.
