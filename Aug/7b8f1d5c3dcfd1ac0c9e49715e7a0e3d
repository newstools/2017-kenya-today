By Hesbon OmIt&#8217;s now apparently clear that IG and Jubilee are hell bent on causing chaos in our country.Invading and dismantling NASA gadgets and using force to disable NASA systems is a clear sign of criminal acts by the jubilee regime&#8230;.VIOLENCE has two faces&#8230;.One face of violence is from the government. The other face will be that from the citizenry. When you push people to the edge,they either submit to criminality or respond to take back their nation&#8230;..Uhuru can not assure Kenyans of their security while at the same time provoking and inviting violence through the police command structures.Totally unacceptable.
