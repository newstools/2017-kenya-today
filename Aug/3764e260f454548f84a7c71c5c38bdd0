The other woman/illicit affair&#8221; angle is a tired, uncreative state operatives black- ops dead ringer. Thugs don&#8217;t do that. I can give enough examples but the best one was with the late Mandela. After going to extremes to prove that Winnie had an affair, even the angelic Nelson could not stomach it. in cases of murder it confuses the spouse, who would have been the most hysterical and effective person in uncovering the ruse. And in the public domain they soil the loss of the innocent life with &#8216;immorality&#8217;. They then sneak in and tell the wife &#8221; we&#8217;re very sorry but don&#8217;t worry, every thing/ project your late husband was undertaking shall not stop&#8221;. Remember how pro-state Christobel Ouko was in the short term&#8230;.need i go on? To think that such a &#8216;Pretty Young Thing&#8217; (PYT;this is their language) in other words a pretty, innocent girl had to be thrown in to fulfill a narrative is so BEASTLY&amp;PATERNALISTIC&#8230;and who&#8217;s more paternalistic than Big B(r)other? and she had to be from the right tribe&#8230;jst like balancing out githeri&#8230;maize then you thrown in a (innocent) bean&#8230;.SMHListen up kids. Before you was in diapers, a minister called Ouko was tortured and killed like Musando was. Back then we didn&#8217;t have or do no hash tags. We went to the streets and made our anger known. Guess who came out in defense of the killers, asking us to get off the streets if we really loved and cared for the deceased. It was the widow, one Christabel Ouko! Before you come flashing that statement from that poor kid&#8217;s sister alleging that she was out having fun with the late Musando, let it be known to you that there are those of us that have seen it all before. We&#8217;ve been there, and seen that.And let us say ~ even if just to prove that the grey stuff between your ears is wet ash ~ that that kid was indeed Musando&#8217;s &#8216;Mpango wa kando&#8217;. Does that make him fair game for the heinous murder? Does it justify the cold blooded murder of the duo? My people say &#8216;monto monene nd&#8217;iogo, mwana moke isuri rianoko&#8217;. Translation: &#8216;An adult is a cure, a kid is a chicken&#8217;s fart.&#8217;
