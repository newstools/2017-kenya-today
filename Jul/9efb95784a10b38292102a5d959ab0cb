Is the Final Piece of Jubilee&#8217;s Attempts to Rig the Outcome of Election 2017 in Place?IEBC&#8217;s refusal to update the presidential results &#8220;real-time&#8221; BUT instead, &#8220;collate all the 290 constituencies and then declare final results&#8221; is proof-positive that the body (along with the incumbent Jubilee Coalition) wants to rig/manipulate the outcome of Election 2017.There is just no other way to interpret this latest move by the commission.This centralization of the vote tallying process is the last and final piece of the puzzle that has been Jubilee&#8217;s efforts to rig the 2017 election &#8211; one it is now poised to lose. It is also a text-book example of &#8220;how-to&#8221; manipulate or falsify data &#8211; which is what happens in a rigged election:Ballot totals (data) are supposedly &#8220;collated&#8221; then announced away from where the actual voting took place thus creating time and opportunity for the &#8220;tharakanithization&#8221; of final results!To be perfectly clear, no election is &#8220;perfect&#8221; but that is NOT the point, certainly not in Kenya, a country with a sordid history of electoral manipulation.Irish philosopher Edmund Burke offered that politics &#8211; and by extension elections &#8211; is a &#8220;computing game&#8221; i.e. a numbers game.Mr. Burke&#8217;s point is further crystallized by Khalil Timamy in a paper titled &#8220;African Leaders and Corruption&#8221;. Mr. Timamy explains why and how African leaders use their position of incumbency to manipulate democratic institutions (such as the IEBC) to retain power AND embezzle economic resources!Finally, Samuel Baligidde, in an article titled &#8220;How rigging of elections in Africa takes place&#8221;, summarizes Edmund Burke&#8217;s and Khalil Timamy&#8217;s thinking re: rigging of elections; thinking reflected in what Kenyans have seen to date:Jubilee&#8217;s AND IEBC&#8217;s deployment of a variety of methods/techniques used to frustrate an opposition agitating for free and fair elections including:&#8211; Violence against those agitating for their democratic rights, &#8211; Criminalization of (expressions of) democratic rights, &#8211; Incarceration of those expressing their democratic rights, &#8211; Illegitimate use of legitimate instruments of law enforcement to terrorize opposition figures and their supporters, &#8211; Intensification of political violence and machination as election day approaches, &#8211; Creation of a pervading sense of insecurity and fear to drive away real and potential voters, &#8211; Delaying delivery of ballot boxes and actual ballots, &#8211; Haphazard or hurried training of election workers &#8211; to increase chances of mistakes that almost always favor the incumbency, &#8211; Refusal to provide &#8220;real-time&#8221; results from election precincts and this latest one, &#8211; Centralization of (final) election results.The foregoing list hits on everything the IEBC and Jubilee have done over the last twelve months with this latest move being a potential coup de grace.Simply put, IEBC&#8217;s decision to delay announcement of potentially adverse votes results is designed to buy them time to adjust the results &#8211; in favor of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto &#8211; Period!
