Fresh from his debate triumph last night, Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga today took his campaign to Meru and Tharaka Nithi. Mr Odinga, together with other NASA principals Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetangula as well as other key leaders including Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama, campaigned in diverse places including Laare, Maili Tatu, and Kinjai, among other places.He re-affirmed his commitment to devolution and pledged that his government will devolve 45 percent of the national revenues.Amid chants of Uhuru Must Go , Odinga asked a charged crowd at Laare of to make sure that the vote is not stolen. Wake up early, vote and those who have volunteered, stay back to protect the vote, he said.Odinga used the rallies to outline the Nasa vision for a better Kenya.Key among them was the promise of free secondary school education, which would start in September if he is elected.Raila blamed President Kenyatta for mismanaging the economy, leading to the high cost of living and high levels of unemployment.He said his government will create an environment for the youth to use their skills to create jobs. We will use the models used in countries such as India, Korea and Singapore. Our young people will become employers, not employees, he said. On the claims that Nasa has set up a tallying centre in Tanzania, he denied it, saying that was propaganda spread by a panicky Jubilee.But he assured supporters that Nasa had established such a centre inside Kenya where the coalition will do its own tallying as a measure against cheating.He wondered why Jubilee was concerned about Nasa s tallying centre, Why are they concerned about us having our own tallying centre, why are they afraid?, he asked.While in 2013 the larger Meru region voted for Kenyatta, the ground has shifted, with Odinga gaining substantially in the region.Jubilee s unfulfilled promises, and the corruption in government have turned the people against the government.
