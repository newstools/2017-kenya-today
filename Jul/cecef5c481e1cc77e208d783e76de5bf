The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has sacked the Nairobi County Deputy Returning officer Seth Ouma Omolo. Omolo was sacked after it was revealed that he has been holding several secret meetings with Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero s aides in a bid to influence the outcome of the Nairobi governor seat race during the upcoming August 8 polls. According to mobile phone recordings in our possession, the sacked IEBC official is overheard saying he has already received a down payment of Sh80m from Kidero s henchmen to strategize on how to rig the August 8 polls in favour of Kidero and deny Senator Mike Sonko who is now Kidero s main headache in his re-election bid. IEBC has already posted a new deputy returning officer to replace Omolo whose fate is still unknown. Kidero is not new to bribery cases involving millions of shillings. Last year he was found guilty of bribing sacked Supreme Court Judge Philip Tunoi with Sh200m to throw out a petition against his win in 2013 polls.
