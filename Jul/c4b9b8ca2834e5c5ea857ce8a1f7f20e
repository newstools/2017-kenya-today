NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has said operation &#8216;linda kura&#8217; is on course and that they have assigned five people to each polling station.This is despite a directive by acting Interior CS Fred Matiang&#8217;i that only authorised officials to man the stations.In addition to official agents, the Opposition intends to have monitors at each polling stations to guard its presidential votes.In June, NASA sought Sh410 million from well wishers for the &#8216;adopt a polling station&#8217; strategy.&#8220;There shall be two agents inside the polling stations with a register of our supporters. The three others will be monitoring the voting progress to ensure all NASA supporters turn out and vote,&#8221; Raila said at a rally in Huruma on Sunday.He said the three monitors will also look at records to confirm how many have voted, those yet to vote and confirm from the queue.&#8220;If a voter will not have voted and is not in the queue, boys will go to their houses to bring them to the polling station to vote,&#8221; the Opposition leader added.Raila asked KDF and police not to allow themselves to be used by &#8220;politicians who have lost&#8221; to scuttle NASA&#8217;s votes.&#8220;Our soldiers have done a wonderful job and are respected in the whole world &#8230; They should leave politics to politicians,&#8221; he said.Matiang&#8217;i said only those credentialed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will remain at voting centres.He asked the commission to issue a circular indicating who should be at the stations. Anyone who is not mentioned in that circular, who is not supposed to be at the polling station, should be removed the fastest way possible and by all means necessary to ensure all polling station are kept orderly, the CS said.
