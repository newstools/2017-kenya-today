IEBC NOW bans personal phones and cameras inside polling stationsThe announcement by Connie Maina, IEBC Vice-Chair today, Thursday, July 27, 2017 that personal phones and cameras are banned inside the polling rooms/stations puts the officials of IEBC deeper and deeper into the hole and is a solid confirmation that Jubilee and IEBC are working together hand in hand to rig the August presidential election. Commissioner Maina&#8217;s illegal directive comes two days after IEBC s Chief Executive Ezra Chiloba said on Tuesday, July 25, 2017 that unlike in previous elections, this year there will be no periodic announcements of the votes that presidential aspirants have received insisting that only the final tally will be announced.NASA has rejected the plan by the electoral commission to announce the results for the presidential election without periodic updates of figures changing when results trickle into the national tallying centre from constituencies. Nasa says the move by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is a mechanism for manipulation and mischief , demanding transparency in the tallying of presidential candidates results. It would appear that the IEBC intends to bury itself at a bunker at Bomas on August 8, 2017 and then come out into the auditorium a day or two later to announce results which have not been received and tallied in an open and transparent manner. In effect, the country will be kept in an agonising suspense as the results are cooked and doctored. It will be d j vu, said James Orengo, co-chairman of Nasa s National Coordinating Committee in a letter to IECB chairman Wafula Chebukati on Wednesday, July 26, 2017.
