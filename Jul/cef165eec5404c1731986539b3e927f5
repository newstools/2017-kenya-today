Final tally of Registered Voters in the IEBC register:- 19,611,423 1% mark up = 196,115 Total Number of Ballots that should be printed, i.e. 101% of registered voters: = 19,807,538Total number of Ballot papers printed by IEBC = 20,818,000 Extra ballots printed above the number of registered voters (20,818,000-19,611,423) = 1,206,577 or 6.15%Each booklet contains 50 leafs. So the number of booklets required for this election for the number of registered voters plus 1% extra = [19,807,538 50]=396,151 booklets. Actual booklets delivered = 416,360 Number of booklets above legally required booklets =[416,360-396,151]=20,209 extra booklets. This translates to 1,010,450 extra ballots, equivalent to 5% of registered voters.UNANSWERED QUESTIONSWHY DO IEBC:- 1) Print over 1 million extra ballots above the legally required number? 2) How are all the extra ballots going to be accounted for? 3) With a maximum of 700 voters per polling station, IEBC will require 14 booklets per station. An even number. There cannot be 100% turnout per polling station so the 1% is very well taken care of by the 14 booklets. How many books will be issue per polling station? 4) With the knowledge of about one million dead voters in the register, was there really a need to print these extra ballots?
