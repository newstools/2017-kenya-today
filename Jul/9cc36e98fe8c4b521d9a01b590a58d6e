By Antony Yugi Njoroge RAILA ODINGA- here&#8217;s my analysis of last evenings Presidential debateYou started off well by passing the message that Kenyans are hurting. This shows the concern you have for Kenyans.One prominent feature of the entire debate was your consistent talk about the high cost of living. This is what&#8217;s driving Jubilee home. It&#8217;s also noteworthy that you placed it as a priority upon you ascending to powerOn the TJRC Report you scored big on two fronts&#8230; the statement about what caused your eye condition got you some points. It showed that you had made a personal sacrifice for Kenyans a fact that majority young voters aged 18- 25 may not know, your statement was super. You also pointed out that Ruto is against the Report. Kenyans will ask him whyThe question on your relationship with Uhuru was tricky but you did well. Your answer showed that you don&#8217;t have personal issues with him and by extension his Kikuyu nation, most of his supporters now are confident you mean well for Kenya and you are a perfect person to fix our collapsing economy that Jubilee has failed to fix.Debates are about what message sticks with people, I called it the Killer Punch. Yours was about single mothers and that your government will support the vulnerable amongst them. That&#8217;s called SMART, that already worn you Uhuru supporters and the undecided. The silent majority supporting NASA will turnout and vote you. It will be a BREXIT and TRUMP moment come 8/8/2017.Uhuru had a chance to challenge you on issues you talked about like his poor performance (incompetence) and corruption but he squandered it. He will forever rue this.Moving forward&#8230;.Stick to your message in last evenings debate especially on cost of living and single mothers and widows Whenever Jubilee challenges you at those rallies please remind them that they are COWARDS who couldn&#8217;t face you and KENYANS. Tell Kenyans that this leadership doesn&#8217;t RESPECT them!You are wrapping this up and God is on your side, His timing is always the best and 8/8/2017 it is!
