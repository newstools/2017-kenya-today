President Uhuru will not attend tonight&#8217;s presidential debate. NASA leader Raila Odinga is live aswering tough questions and addressing the nation. Word has it that the president skipped the debate for he could not answer tough questions on massive corruption, tribalism, collapsing economy, unemployment, insecurity, massive external debt, influx of Chinase nationals doing basic jobs among other ills afflicting the country under Jubilee regime
