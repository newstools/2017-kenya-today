By Oketch Okoth PatriqueKenya Defence Force (KDF) spokesman Joseph Owuoth has confirmed authenticity of documents presented by National Super Alliance (NASA) on operation Dumisha Utulivu by military. However, he said they were quoted out of context and military was apolitical and professional at large.The very fact that the military has confirmed authenticity of the presented documents is a red flag in itself. Claims by the spokesperson that they are apolitical is total swinewash.If the military is non partisan, professional an outfit that is apolitical then why are they being deployed for duties in a civilian exercise. #RailaDoesNotLie
